Worked in a team of 4 to create a journal website for the company, using designs created by the UI/UX designer. The website fetched data from a headless CMS hosted externally, which allowed for the client to be able to modify the sites content without developer intervention.

The site was developed using NEXT.js- a react framework- and Tailwind CSS was used to make development faster whilst mainting control over the styling.
